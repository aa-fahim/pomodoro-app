Ideas:
    - right now, we have a start and stop button
        - should we replace this with one button, that starts or stops depending if 
        timer is on or off

To do:
    - add context api to control study and break periods from timer screen and profile screen
    - add stats to profile screen
    - control study and break peridos from profile screen
    - add info screen about pomodoro timers
    - can we change color of button briefly when pressed
