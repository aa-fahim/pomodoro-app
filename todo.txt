Ideas:
  - change start/stop button to use icons instead of text, and reset button to use icon also
    - i think we do this when there's too much content on the screen, for now this is fine

To do:
    - make nicer component to display stats in ProfileScreen
    - add context api to control study and break periods from timer screen and profile screen
      - added to control study period but not break period
    - control study and break peridos from profile screen (https://openbase.com/js/react-duration-picker/documentation)
    - add info screen about pomodoro timers
    - can we change color of button briefly when pressed
    - add font style
    - dark theme mode
