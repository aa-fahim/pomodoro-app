Ideas:
  - change start/stop button to use icons instead of text, and reset button to use icon also
    - i think we do this when there's too much content on the screen, for now this is fine

To do:
    - make nicer component to display stats in ProfileScreen
    - add context api to control study and break periods from timer screen and profile screen
      - added to control study period but not break period
    - control study and break peridos from profile screen (https://openbase.com/js/react-duration-picker/documentation)
    - add info screen about pomodoro timers
    - can we change color of button briefly when pressed
    - add font style
    - dark theme mode
    - I don't think we break when we find duplicate username or email in
      register API, so we did up creating the account but sending the client 
      as message of account already exists with this email or username
